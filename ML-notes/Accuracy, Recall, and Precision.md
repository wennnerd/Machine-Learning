# Accuracy, Recall, and Precision

**Contents**

[**Accuracy**](#acc)

[**Recall**](#recall)

[**Precision**](#pre)

Consider that using machine learning algorithm to predict whether or not you will get above a B on a test. Then we have the following feature:

* The number of hours you studied this week.  
* The number of hours you watched Netflix this week.  
* The time you went to bed the night before the test.  
* Your average in the class before taking the test.
