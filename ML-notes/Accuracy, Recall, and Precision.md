Consider that using machine learning algorithm to predict whether or not you will get above a B on a test. Then we have the following feature:  
* The number of hours you studied this week.  
* The number of hours you watched Netflix this week.  
* The time you went to bed the night before the test.  
* Your average in the class before taking the test.  

First, define our terms of grade:  
* True Positive: The algorithm predicted you would get above a B, and you did.
* True Negative: The algorithm predicted you would get below a B, and you did.
* False Positive: The algorithm predicted you would get above a B, and you didn’t.
* False Negative: The algorithm predicted you would get below a B, and you didn’t.
