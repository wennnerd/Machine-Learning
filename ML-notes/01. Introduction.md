# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Machine Learning Process

The process of performing Machine Learning often requires many more steps before and after the predictive analytics.We try to think of the Machine Learning process as:

1. Formulating a Question


2. Finding and Understanding the Data


3. Cleaning the Data and Feature Engineering


4. Choosing a Model


5. Tuning and Evaluating


6. Using the Model and Presenting Results

## Supervised v.s. Unsupervised

**Supervised Learning**: data is labeled and the program learns to predict the output from the input data
**Unsupervised Learning**: data is unlabeled and the program learns to recognize the inherent structure in the input data
