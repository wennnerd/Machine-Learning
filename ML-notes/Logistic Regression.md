# Logistic Regression

Consider an simple data which ```y``` is either 1 (passing), or 0 (failing), and we have one feature, ```num_hours_studied```.
In this example, we want to predict the propability of passing which does not provided by output of **Linear Regression model**. Therefore, we step in **Logistic Regression**
